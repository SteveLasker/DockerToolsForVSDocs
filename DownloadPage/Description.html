<h1>Develop, Run, Debug, Update your ASP.NET Core Applications in a Docker Container</h1>
<p>Develop your applications in the environment your targeting using the latest preview of Docker Tool for Visual Studio. Find those pesky bugs that only crop up when deployed, using F5 to debug your application directly in a locally hosted Docker Container,  or CTRL + F5 to edit and refresh your application without having to rebuild the container.</p>

<h1>Version History</h1>
<h2>Version 0.40.0 Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Switch to a single dockerfile. In previous releases we had separate dockerfiles for debug and release. This provided the customization for the development experience, providing a fast iterative loop while developing, while providing an optimized image for production where startup time is a higher priority. With 0.40, we've switched to using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview">docker-compose -f </a> to pass additonal docker-compose.dev.debug|release.yml files. These additional compose files are passed in addition to the docker-compose.yml file to overlay additional settings, such as the volume maps for the course, debugger and nuget packages. </li>
<li>Switched to using volume mapping for the BIN output, the debugger and the local nuget cache. A significant amount of time was spent copying in the context, debugger and restoring nuget packages within the image. By leveraging volume mounts, the iterative development experience is faster, leveraging the nugett cache and debugger on your development machine. This does mean the :dev image is empty. Remember to build a release image if you plan to push a locally built image to a remote host. </li>
<li>Remove of the DockerTask.ps1/sh files. We had initially added these script files to ease customization of our compile/build/compose workflows. These scripts became more complex than our initial intention. With .NET Core moving from xproj to csproj and MS build, we will leverage MS Build customization.</li>
<li>Moved to optimized images. When building ASP.NET Core Web Applications,  dockerfile FROM will reference the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/aspnetcore">microsoft/aspnetcore:1.0.1</a> image. This image includes the ASP.NET Core Nuget packages, which have been pre-jitted improving startup performance. When building .NET Core Console Applications, dockerfile FROM will reference the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet">microsoft/dotnet:1.0.1</a> image. </li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li>Release to support ASP.NET 5 RC1. </li>

The latest implementation of Docker is more strict in how it handles the * in domain names in certificates.  Certificates that were previously generated with previous versions of tools in the *.cloudapp.azure.com format are no longer accepted as the location of the VM host is not required (e.g. *.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com). Certificates may now only be re-used with  VM in the same region. To use the v0.9 of the tools you have to delete the certificates in&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\.docker and re-create your container hosts. </li>

Tooling will be updated as Windows Nano containers  are available.</em> </li>
